# Istex-exchange

Istex-exchange is a bundle of  transform stream and utility function to generate Kbart  and institutional holdings from Lodex powered app, revue-sommaire.istex.fr.

Under the wood it works with [highlandjs](https://caolan.github.io/highland/) and mainly return [through](https://caolan.github.io/highland/#through) function that can be unwrapped to become basics node stream with [toNodeStream](https://caolan.github.io/highland/#toNodeStream).

This is an Istex business module and it needs revue de sommaire and Istex API to works.
